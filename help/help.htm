<p>To play tetris, JavaScript has to be enabled in the browser of the visitor.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerability-of-highscores">Vulnerability of highscores</h3>

<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Tetris_XH is based on Tetris with jQuery by Franck Marcia. Many thanks to him for developing this nice and simple implementation of Tetris and releasing the code under an open source license.</p>
<p>The plugin icon is designed by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/atux">AtuX</a>. Many thanks for publishing this icon under a liberal license.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the community at the <a href="https://cmsimpleforum.com/">CMSimple_XH Forum</a> for tips, suggestions and testing. Particularly I want to thank <em>Gert</em> and <em>oldnema</em> for their suggestions to improve Tetris_XH. And I have to apologize to <em>bca</em>, who tested the online demo first, but was not able to save his highscore because of a bug in the plugin.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Luda Wieland who pointed out that the highscores could not be written on installations in a <code>UserDir</code> and helped with debugging the problem.</p>
<p>And last but not least many thanks to <a href="http://www.harteg.dk/">Peter Harteg</a>, the “father” of CMSimple, and all developers of <a href="https://www.cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a> without whom this amazing CMS would not exist.</p>
